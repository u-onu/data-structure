# Trees
Def: A tree is finite set T of nodes such that
    (1) T has one special node called root
    (2) The remaining nodes are partitioned into m disjoint sets T1, T2, ..., Tm, and
        each of these sets are in turn in a tree. We call them subtrees.

# Binary Trees
Def: A binary tree is a finite set of nodes either is empty of, (if not empty) consists
    of a root and two disjoint binary trees that are called the left subtree and the right
    subtree.

# Enumeration of Binary Trees
t(0) = 1
t(n) = t(n - 1)t(0) + t(n - 2)t(1) + ... + t(0)t(n - 1)
